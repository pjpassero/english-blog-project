                        World War Two was beginning around the end of the Great Depression. The Great Depression was
                        about ten years long and it was caused by the Stock Market Crash of 1929. A depression is when
                        there is a contraction in economic activity. This basically means, that businesses aren’t
                        selling as much as they were before, which furthermore means that the demand for certain
                        products had lowered. The result of the Great Depression was that the global economy shrank by
                        nearly 25%. The Great Depression caused many to lose their jobs, which meant many went hungry
                        and couldn’t support things financially.

                        The graph above shows the unemployment rate through the 1930s into the mid-1940s. It shows how
                        the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 25% in the United States in 1933. This means that there
                        were a lot of people out of work. This was on peak in the graph, and then the rate began to
                        fall, until rising slightly in 1938. The graph shows a direct correlation between decreasing
                        unemployment rates and the United States entering WWII. Although war is never a good thing, WWII
                        being the worst war of them all, the war helped the United States economy bounce back from the
                        depression. The fascinating part about all this was that towards the end of the war, the
                        unemployment rate sank to nearly 1%, which shows the amount of work that was needed to support
                        the war effort. When the United States joined the war, there was an increased demand for
                        supplies to fight such as weapons, vehicles, ammunition, etc.

                        A couple of months before the US entered the war, many US factories changed their production
                        lines to produce the necessary items for the United States to go to war. For example, the Ford
                        Motor Company located in Detroit Michigan, converted their production lines to make <a

                            Liberators.</a>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        This gave the need for new workers at these factories to meet demand. The demand for the
                        unemployed was not the only demand that was needed, other groups were able to get jobs as well
                        such as teens who just turned 18 and many minority groups. This set up for a good recovery from
                        the depression. People were glad to be working and making a living again.

                        The war began to come to an end in 1945. The government began programs to help pay for the war.
                        One specific thing they did was start the war savings bonds program. Bonds are used to helping
                        pay for debt or raise money for something and they are typically used by a government. People
                        can buy bonds and hold them until they mature. Two common bonds that the US government issues
                        are <a href="">Series EE</a> and <a href="">Series Is</a>

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        Not only were people investing in savings bonds, but they also were buying homes, cars, starting
                        families, and much more. Wartime restrictions on metals, fuels, and other necessities for war
                        were also lifted allowing companies to once again switch their production lines to make consumer
                        products again. This led to a lot more innovation in the consumer world with household
                        appliances and more. Overall, even though WWII is looked at as being dark and sad, it still is,
                        but looking into the good that came out of it brightens the topic. A good question to ask would
                        be what would the US economy look like without the war, would it look the same, would it be
                        different? The war helped people get back to work and placed the US back onto its feet.
