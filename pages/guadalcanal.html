                        After the war was declared on Japan by the United States, soldiers were shipped to Japan to
                        fight. Japan had very dense jungles that US soldiers had to fight in during WWII. War and
                        fighting are never good in the first place, but when you add in a vast unknown location, it only
                        gets more dangerous. As stated, these jungles were very dense meaning you could lose your sense
                        of direction stepping even 10 feet into the jungle. The jungles were also typically very hot and
                        muggy. This meant soldiers got infections and sickness due to wet clothing. Dehydration was also
                        a huge problem since the water was also limited, soldiers typically rationed out the water they
                        had so it lasted for the duration of their mission. One specific battle fought in the jungle
                        terrain was the Battle of Guadalcanal. Guadalcanal is located in the Soloman Islands.
                        Guadalcanal was of course a jungle region and had an area of about 2,500 miles.
